### Flagship theme is a vanilla, mobile first, responsive parent theme framework to extend WordPress site building.

[Flagship Theme](http://flagshiptheme.com/) is released under a GPLv2 License.

####Built in CSS Minification & Caching
Flagship aggregates and condenses the core stylesheets used by the framework. Developers can utilize framework hooks to add child theme stylesheets into the cached and minified stylesheet.

####Theme Building
Flagship uses WordPress sidebars as "zones" to make a theme developer's life a little bit easier. No longer will you need to hardcode a website template, but simply arrange theme zones. If you've used Drupal, this should be a familar process.

####Configuration Files
Flagship utilizes configuration files in JSON format. This allows theme developers to easily create zone templates, export them, and have them instantly available when creating new child themes.
